This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.\\n\",\n",
       " '__label__2 Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you\\'ve played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time\\'s Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer\\'s work (I haven\\'t heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can\\'t say for sure), and even if you\\'ve never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.\\n',\n",

I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross\\n\",\n",

The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.\\n\"]"
